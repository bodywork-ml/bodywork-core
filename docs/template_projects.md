# Template Projects

To accelerate the development of your own projects, we maintain a set of Bodywork template projects for common use-cases:

* [batch job](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-batch-job-project)
* [model-scoring REST API](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-serve-model-project)
* [train-and-serve ML pipeline](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-pipeline-project)

## Working with GitHub Template Repositories

Bodywork template projects are [GitHub template repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that can be automatically copied into your own GitHub account by clicking the `Use this template` button as shown below.

From this point you will be able to deploy the Bodywork template project directly to Kubernetes using the steps in the project's `README`. You can then edit the files in the cloned template project to meet your own project's requirements.

If you want to make these repositories private, then make sure to follow the necessary configuration steps as detailed [here](user_guide.md#working-with-private-git-repositories-using-ssh).
