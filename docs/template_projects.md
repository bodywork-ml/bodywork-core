# Template Projects

To accelerate the development of your projects, we have provided a set of Bodywork templates for the following deployment use-cases:

* [batch job](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-batch-job-project)
* [model-scoring REST API](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-serve-model-project)
* [train-and-deploy ML pipeline](https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project)

## Working with GitHub Template Projects

Bodywork template projects are [GitHub template repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that can be automatically cloned directly into your own GitHub account by clicking the `Use this template` button as shown below.

From this point you will be able to deploy the Bodywork template project directly to Kubernetes using the steps in the project's `README`. You can then edit the files in the cloned template project to meet your own project's requirements.
